I have worn all 7 of my babies and ensure each sling is carefully made for the precious babies it will hold. \n\n*Each sling is approximately 30 inches wide and 80+ inches long to accommodate breastfeeding, multiple caregivers and ultimately, keep you comfortable during wear. \n\n*Each sling is made with large aluminum or nylon rings from SlingRings.com which are tested for babywearing safety.","creation_tsz":1464057930,"ending_tsz":1474685130,"original_creation_tsz":1443731982,"last_modified_tsz":1469986038,"price":"60.00","currency_code":"CAD","quantity":1,"tags":["woven sling","floral","peach","baby carrier","vintage inspired","retro","baby wrap","ring sling","baby shower","canadian made","attachment parenting","holistic parenting","new parent gift"],"category_path":["Bags and Purses"],"category_path_ids":[69150455],"materials":["cotton linen","aluminum rings","cotton thread"],"shop_section_id":10609213,"featured_rank":2,"state_tsz":1443731982,"url":"https://www.etsy.com/listing/250201719/sale-linen-and-lace-vintage-inspired?utm_source=etsyinventorymerger\u0026utm_medium=api\u0026utm_campaign=api","views":302,"num_favorers":10,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2016","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":135,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Baby Accessories","Baby Carriers \u0026 Wraps"],"used_manufacturer":false},"token":null,"secret":null},{"result":{"listing_id":264848330,"state":"active","user_id":14260812,"category_id":68906334,"title":"Natural Wooden Teether","description":"These natural wooden teething rings are perfect for keeping little hands busy, and helping with tender new teeth.
